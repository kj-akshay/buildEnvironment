<h3 class="section" id="Remote-Protocol-Support-for-Non_002dStop-Mode"><span>E.11 Remote Protocol Support for Non-Stop Mode<a class="copiable-link" href="#Remote-Protocol-Support-for-Non_002dStop-Mode"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p><small class="sc">GDB</small>&rsquo;s remote protocol supports non-stop debugging of
multi-threaded programs, as described in <a class="ref" href="Non_002dStop-Mode.html">Non-Stop Mode</a>.  If the stub
supports non-stop mode, it should report that to <small class="sc">GDB</small> by including
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">QNonStop+</samp>&rsquo; in its &lsquo;<samp class="samp">qSupported</samp>&rsquo; response (see <a class="pxref" href="General-Query-Packets.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).
</p>
<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> typically sends a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">QNonStop</samp>&rsquo; packet only when
establishing a new connection with the stub.  Entering non-stop mode
does not alter the state of any currently-running threads, but targets
must stop all threads in any already-attached processes when entering
all-stop mode.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> uses the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; packet as necessary to
probe the target state after a mode change.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, when an attached process encounters an event that
would otherwise be reported with a stop reply, it uses the
asynchronous notification mechanism (see <a class="pxref" href="Notification-Packets.html">Notification Packets</a>) to
inform <small class="sc">GDB</small>.  In contrast to all-stop mode, where all threads
in all processes are stopped when a stop reply is sent, in non-stop
mode only the thread reporting the stop event is stopped.  That is,
when reporting a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">S</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">T</samp>&rsquo; response to indicate completion
of a step operation, hitting a breakpoint, or a fault, only the
affected thread is stopped; any other still-running threads continue
to run.  When reporting a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">W</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">X</samp>&rsquo; response, all running
threads belonging to other attached processes continue to run.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, the target shall respond to the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; packet as
follows.  First, any incomplete stop reply notification/&lsquo;<samp class="samp">vStopped</samp>&rsquo; 
sequence in progress is abandoned.  The target must begin a new
sequence reporting stop events for all stopped threads, whether or not
it has previously reported those events to <small class="sc">GDB</small>.  The first
stop reply is sent as a synchronous reply to the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; packet, and
subsequent stop replies are sent as responses to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">vStopped</samp>&rsquo; packets
using the mechanism described above.  The target must not send
asynchronous stop reply notifications until the sequence is complete.
If all threads are running when the target receives the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; packet,
or if the target is not attached to any process, it shall respond
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">OK</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If the stub supports non-stop mode, it should also support the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">swbreak</samp>&rsquo; stop reason if software breakpoints are supported, and
the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">hwbreak</samp>&rsquo; stop reason if hardware breakpoints are supported
(see <a class="pxref" href="Stop-Reply-Packets.html#swbreak-stop-reason">swbreak stop reason</a>).  This is because given the asynchronous
nature of non-stop mode, between the time a thread hits a breakpoint
and the time the event is finally processed by <small class="sc">GDB</small>, the
breakpoint may have already been removed from the target.  Due to
this, <small class="sc">GDB</small> needs to be able to tell whether a trap stop was
caused by a delayed breakpoint event, which should be ignored, as
opposed to a random trap signal, which should be reported to the user.
Note the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">swbreak</samp>&rsquo; feature implies that the target is responsible
for adjusting the PC when a software breakpoint triggers, if
necessary, such as on the x86 architecture.
