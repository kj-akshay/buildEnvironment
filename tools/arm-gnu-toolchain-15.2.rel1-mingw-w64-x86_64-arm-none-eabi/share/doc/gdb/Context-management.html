<p>In most cases when <small class="sc">GDB</small> accesses the target, this access is
done in context of a specific thread and frame (see <a class="pxref" href="Frames.html">Stack Frames</a>).
Often, even when accessing global data, the target requires that a thread
be specified.  The CLI interface maintains the selected thread and frame,
and supplies them to target on each command.  This is convenient,
because a command line user would not want to specify that information
explicitly on each command, and because user interacts with
<small class="sc">GDB</small> via a single terminal, so no confusion is possible as 
to what thread and frame are the current ones.
</p>
<p>In the case of MI, the concept of selected thread and frame is less
useful.  First, a frontend can easily remember this information
itself.  Second, a graphical frontend can have more than one window,
each one used for debugging a different thread, and the frontend might
want to access additional threads for internal purposes.  This
increases the risk that by relying on implicitly selected thread, the
frontend may be operating on a wrong one.  Therefore, each MI command
should explicitly specify which thread and frame to operate on.  To
make it possible, each MI command accepts the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">--thread</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">--frame</samp>&rsquo; options, the value to each is <small class="sc">GDB</small> global
identifier for thread and frame to operate on.
</p>
<p>Usually, each top-level window in a frontend allows the user to select
a thread and a frame, and remembers the user selection for further
operations.  However, in some cases <small class="sc">GDB</small> may suggest that the
current thread or frame be changed.  For example, when stopping on a
breakpoint it is reasonable to switch to the thread where breakpoint is
hit.  For another example, if the user issues the CLI &lsquo;<samp class="samp">thread</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">frame</samp>&rsquo; commands via the frontend, it is desirable to change the
frontend&rsquo;s selection to the one specified by user.  <small class="sc">GDB</small>
communicates the suggestion to change current thread and frame using the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">=thread-selected</samp>&rsquo; notification.
</p>
<p>Note that historically, MI shares the selected thread with CLI, so 
frontends used the <code class="code">-thread-select</code> to execute commands in the
right context.  However, getting this to work right is cumbersome.  The
simplest way is for frontend to emit <code class="code">-thread-select</code> command
before every command.  This doubles the number of commands that need
to be sent.  The alternative approach is to suppress <code class="code">-thread-select</code>
if the selected thread in <small class="sc">GDB</small> is supposed to be identical to the
thread the frontend wants to operate on.  However, getting this
optimization right can be tricky.  In particular, if the frontend
sends several commands to <small class="sc">GDB</small>, and one of the commands changes the
selected thread, then the behavior of subsequent commands will
change.  So, a frontend should either wait for response from such
problematic commands, or explicitly add <code class="code">-thread-select</code> for
all subsequent commands.  No frontend is known to do this exactly
right, so it is suggested to just always pass the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">--thread</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">--frame</samp>&rsquo; options.

<div class="subsubsection-level-extent" id="Language">
<h4 class="subsubsection"><span>27.1.1.2 Language<a class="copiable-link" href="#Language"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>The execution of several commands depends on which language is selected.
By default, the current language (see <a class="pxref" href="Show.html#show-language">show language</a>) is used.
But for commands known to be language-sensitive, it is recommended
to use the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">--language</samp>&rsquo; option.  This option takes one argument,
which is the name of the language to use while executing the command.
For instance:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">-data-evaluate-expression --language c &quot;sizeof (void*)&quot;
^done,value=&quot;4&quot;
(gdb) 
</pre></div>

<p>The valid language names are the same names accepted by the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">set language</samp>&rsquo; command (see <a class="pxref" href="Manually.html">Setting the Working Language</a>), excluding &lsquo;<samp class="samp">auto</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">local</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">unknown</samp>&rsquo;.
