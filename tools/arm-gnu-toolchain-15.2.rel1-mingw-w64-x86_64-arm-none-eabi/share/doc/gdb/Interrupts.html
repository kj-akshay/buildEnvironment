<p>In all-stop mode, when a program on the remote target is running,
<small class="sc">GDB</small> may attempt to interrupt it by sending a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Ctrl-C</samp>&rsquo;,
<code class="code">BREAK</code> or a <code class="code">BREAK</code> followed by <code class="code">g</code>, control of which
is specified via <small class="sc">GDB</small>&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp class="samp">interrupt-sequence</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The precise meaning of <code class="code">BREAK</code> is defined by the transport
mechanism and may, in fact, be undefined.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> does not
currently define a <code class="code">BREAK</code> mechanism for any of the network
interfaces except for TCP, in which case <small class="sc">GDB</small> sends the
<code class="code">telnet</code> BREAK sequence.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">Ctrl-C</samp>&rsquo;, on the other hand, is defined and implemented for all
transport mechanisms.  It is represented by sending the single byte
<code class="code">0x03</code> without any of the usual packet overhead described in
the Overview section (see <a class="pxref" href="Overview.html">Overview</a>).  When a <code class="code">0x03</code> byte is
transmitted as part of a packet, it is considered to be packet data
and does <em class="emph">not</em> represent an interrupt.  E.g., an &lsquo;<samp class="samp">X</samp>&rsquo; packet
(see <a class="pxref" href="Packets.html#X-packet">X packet</a>), used for binary downloads, may include an unescaped
<code class="code">0x03</code> as part of its packet.
</p>
<p><code class="code">BREAK</code> followed by <code class="code">g</code> is also known as Magic SysRq g.
When Linux kernel receives this sequence from serial port,
it stops execution and connects to gdb.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, because packet resumptions are asynchronous
(see <a class="pxref" href="Packets.html#vCont-packet">vCont packet</a>), <small class="sc">GDB</small> is always free to send a remote
command to the remote stub, even when the target is running.  For that
reason, <small class="sc">GDB</small> instead sends a regular packet (see <a class="pxref" href="Packets.html#vCtrlC-packet">vCtrlC packet</a>) with the usual packet framing instead of the single byte
<code class="code">0x03</code>.
</p>
<p>Stubs are not required to recognize these interrupt mechanisms and the
precise meaning associated with receipt of the interrupt is
implementation defined.  If the target supports debugging of multiple
threads and/or processes, it should attempt to interrupt all 
currently-executing threads and processes.
If the stub is successful at interrupting the
running program, it should send one of the stop
reply packets (see <a class="pxref" href="Stop-Reply-Packets.html">Stop Reply Packets</a>) to <small class="sc">GDB</small> as a result
of successfully stopping the program in all-stop mode, and a stop reply
for each stopped thread in non-stop mode.
Interrupts received while the
program is stopped are queued and the program will be interrupted when
it is resumed next time.
