<p>A <small class="sc">GDB</small> command is a single line of input.  There is no limit on
how long it can be.  It starts with a command name, which is followed by
arguments whose meaning depends on the command name.  For example, the
command <code class="code">step</code> accepts an argument which is the number of times to
step, as in &lsquo;<samp class="samp">step 5</samp>&rsquo;.  You can also use the <code class="code">step</code> command
with no arguments.  Some commands do not allow any arguments.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-abbreviation"></a>
<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> command names may always be truncated if that abbreviation is
unambiguous.  Other possible command abbreviations are listed in the
documentation for individual commands.  In some cases, even ambiguous
abbreviations are allowed; for example, <code class="code">s</code> is specially defined as
equivalent to <code class="code">step</code> even though there are other commands whose
names start with <code class="code">s</code>.  You can test abbreviations by using them as
arguments to the <code class="code">help</code> command.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-repeating-commands"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-RET-_0028repeat-last-command_0029"></a>
<p>A blank line as input to <small class="sc">GDB</small> (typing just <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>) means to
repeat the previous command.  Certain commands (for example, <code class="code">run</code>)
will not repeat this way; these are commands whose unintentional
repetition might cause trouble and which you are unlikely to want to
repeat.  User-defined commands can disable this feature; see
<a class="ref" href="Define.html">dont-repeat</a>.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">list</code> and <code class="code">x</code> commands, when you repeat them with
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>, construct new arguments rather than repeating
exactly as typed.  This permits easy scanning of source or memory.
</p>
<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> can also use <kbd class="key">RET</kbd> in another way: to partition lengthy
output, in a way similar to the common utility <code class="code">more</code>
(see <a class="pxref" href="Screen-Size.html">Screen Size</a>).  Since it is easy to press one
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd> too many in this situation, <small class="sc">GDB</small> disables command
repetition after any command that generates this sort of display.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_0023-_0028a-comment_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-comment"></a>
<p>Any text from a <kbd class="kbd">#</kbd> to the end of the line is a comment; it does
nothing.  This is useful mainly in command files (see <a class="pxref" href="Command-Files.html">Command Files</a>).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-repeating-command-sequences"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Ctrl_002do-_0028operate_002dand_002dget_002dnext_0029"></a>
<p>The <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl-o</kbd> binding is useful for repeating a complex sequence of
commands.  This command accepts the current line, like <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>, and
then fetches the next line relative to the current line from the history
for editing.
