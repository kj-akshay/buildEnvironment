<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-command-files"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-scripting-commands"></a>
<p>A command file for <small class="sc">GDB</small> is a text file made of lines that are
<small class="sc">GDB</small> commands.  Comments (lines starting with <kbd class="kbd">#</kbd>) may
also be included.  An empty line in a command file does nothing; it
does not mean to repeat the last command, as it would from the
terminal.
</p>
<p>You can request the execution of a command file with the <code class="code">source</code>
command.  Note that the <code class="code">source</code> command is also used to evaluate
scripts that are not Command Files.  The exact behavior can be configured
using the <code class="code">script-extension</code> setting.
See <a class="xref" href="Extending-GDB.html">Extending GDB</a>.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-execute-commands-from-a-file"></a>
<a id="index-source"></a><span><code class="code">source [-s] [-v] <var class="var">filename</var></code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-source"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Execute the command file <var class="var">filename</var>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The lines in a command file are generally executed sequentially,
unless the order of execution is changed by one of the
<em class="emph">flow-control commands</em> described below.  The commands are not
printed as they are executed.  An error in any command terminates
execution of the command file and control is returned to the console.
</p>
<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> first searches for <var class="var">filename</var> in the current directory.
If the file is not found there, and <var class="var">filename</var> does not specify a
directory, then <small class="sc">GDB</small> also looks for the file on the source search path
(specified with the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">directory</samp>&rsquo; command);
except that <samp class="file">$cdir</samp> is not searched because the compilation directory
is not relevant to scripts.
</p>
<p>If <code class="code">-s</code> is specified, then <small class="sc">GDB</small> searches for <var class="var">filename</var>
on the search path even if <var class="var">filename</var> specifies a directory.
The search is done by appending <var class="var">filename</var> to each element of the
search path.  So, for example, if <var class="var">filename</var> is <samp class="file">mylib/myscript</samp>
and the search path contains <samp class="file">/home/user</samp> then <small class="sc">GDB</small> will
look for the script <samp class="file">/home/user/mylib/myscript</samp>.
The search is also done if <var class="var">filename</var> is an absolute path.
For example, if <var class="var">filename</var> is <samp class="file">/tmp/myscript</samp> and
the search path contains <samp class="file">/home/user</samp> then <small class="sc">GDB</small> will
look for the script <samp class="file">/home/user/tmp/myscript</samp>.
For DOS-like systems, if <var class="var">filename</var> contains a drive specification,
it is stripped before concatenation.  For example, if <var class="var">filename</var> is
<samp class="file">d:myscript</samp> and the search path contains <samp class="file">c:/tmp</samp> then <small class="sc">GDB</small>
will look for the script <samp class="file">c:/tmp/myscript</samp>.
</p>
<p>If <code class="code">-v</code>, for verbose mode, is given then <small class="sc">GDB</small> displays
each command as it is executed.  The option must be given before
<var class="var">filename</var>, and is interpreted as part of the filename anywhere else.
</p>
<p>Commands that would ask for confirmation if used interactively proceed
without asking when used in a command file.  Many <small class="sc">GDB</small> commands that
normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the messages
when called from command files.
</p>
<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> also accepts command input from standard input.  In this
mode, normal output goes to standard output and error output goes to
standard error.  Errors in a command file supplied on standard input do
not terminate execution of the command file&mdash;execution continues with
the next command.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">gdb &lt; cmds &gt; log 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre></div>

<p>(The syntax above will vary depending on the shell used.) This example
will execute commands from the file <samp class="file">cmds</samp>. All output and errors
would be directed to <samp class="file">log</samp>.
</p>
<p>Since commands stored on command files tend to be more general than
commands typed interactively, they frequently need to deal with
complicated situations, such as different or unexpected values of
variables and symbols, changes in how the program being debugged is
built, etc.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> provides a set of flow-control commands to
deal with these complexities.  Using these commands, you can write
complex scripts that loop over data structures, execute commands
conditionally, etc.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-else"></a>
<a id="index-if"></a><span><code class="code">if</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-if"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dt><code class="code">else</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command allows to include in your script conditionally executed
commands. The <code class="code">if</code> command takes a single argument, which is an
expression to evaluate.  It is followed by a series of commands that
are executed only if the expression is true (its value is nonzero).
There can then optionally be an <code class="code">else</code> line, followed by a series
of commands that are only executed if the expression was false.  The
end of the list is marked by a line containing <code class="code">end</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-while"></a><span><code class="code">while</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-while"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command allows to write loops.  Its syntax is similar to
<code class="code">if</code>: the command takes a single argument, which is an expression
to evaluate, and must be followed by the commands to execute, one per
line, terminated by an <code class="code">end</code>.  These commands are called the
<em class="dfn">body</em> of the loop.  The commands in the body of <code class="code">while</code> are
executed repeatedly as long as the expression evaluates to true.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-loop_005fbreak"></a><span><code class="code">loop_break</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-loop_005fbreak"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command exits the <code class="code">while</code> loop in whose body it is included.
Execution of the script continues after that <code class="code">while</code>s <code class="code">end</code>
line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-loop_005fcontinue"></a><span><code class="code">loop_continue</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-loop_005fcontinue"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command skips the execution of the rest of the body of commands
in the <code class="code">while</code> loop in whose body it is included.  Execution
branches to the beginning of the <code class="code">while</code> loop, where it evaluates
the controlling expression.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-end-_0028if_002felse_002fwhile-commands_0029"></a><span><code class="code">end</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-end-_0028if_002felse_002fwhile-commands_0029"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Terminate the block of commands that are the body of <code class="code">if</code>,
<code class="code">else</code>, or <code class="code">while</code> flow-control commands.
</p></dd>
