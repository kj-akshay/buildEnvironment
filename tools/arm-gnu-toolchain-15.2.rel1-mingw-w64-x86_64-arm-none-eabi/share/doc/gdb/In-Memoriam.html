<p>The <small class="sc">GDB</small> project mourns the loss of the following long-time
contributors:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><code class="code">Fred Fish</code></dt>
<dd><p>Fred was a long-standing contributor to <small class="sc">GDB</small> (1991-2006), and
to Free Software in general.  Outside of <small class="sc">GDB</small>, he was known in
the Amiga world for his series of Fish Disks, and the GeekGadget project.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">Michael Snyder</code></dt>
<dd><p>Michael was one of the Global Maintainers of the <small class="sc">GDB</small> project,
with contributions recorded as early as 1996, until 2011.  In addition
to his day to day participation, he was a large driving force behind
adding Reverse Debugging to <small class="sc">GDB</small>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Beyond their technical contributions to the project, they were also
enjoyable members of the Free Software Community.  We will miss them.
