<p>These commands are deprecated; they are equivalent to plain <code class="code">disable</code> and <code class="code">enable</code>.

<dd><p>Disable tracepoint <var class="var">num</var>, or all tracepoints if no argument
<var class="var">num</var> is given.  A disabled tracepoint will have no effect during
a trace experiment, but it is not forgotten.  You can re-enable
a disabled tracepoint using the <code class="code">enable tracepoint</code> command.
If the command is issued during a trace experiment and the debug target
has support for disabling tracepoints during a trace experiment, then the
change will be effective immediately.  Otherwise, it will be applied to the
next trace experiment.

<dd><p>Enable tracepoint <var class="var">num</var>, or all tracepoints.  If this command is
issued during a trace experiment and the debug target supports enabling
tracepoints during a trace experiment, then the enabled tracepoints will
become effective immediately.  Otherwise, they will become effective the
next time a trace experiment is run.
