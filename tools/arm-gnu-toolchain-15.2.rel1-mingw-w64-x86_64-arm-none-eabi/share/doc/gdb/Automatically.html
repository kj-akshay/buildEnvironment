<h4 class="subsection" id="Having-gdb-Infer-the-Source-Language"><span>15.1.3 Having <small class="sc">GDB</small> Infer the Source Language<a class="copiable-link" href="#Having-gdb-Infer-the-Source-Language"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>To have <small class="sc">GDB</small> set the working language automatically, use
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">set language local</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">set language auto</samp>&rsquo;.  <small class="sc">GDB</small>
then infers the working language.  That is, when your program stops in a
frame (usually by encountering a breakpoint), <small class="sc">GDB</small> sets the
working language to the language recorded for the function in that
frame.  If the language for a frame is unknown (that is, if the function
or block corresponding to the frame was defined in a source file that
does not have a recognized extension), the current working language is
not changed, and <small class="sc">GDB</small> issues a warning.
</p>
<p>This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written
entirely in one source language.  However, program modules and libraries
written in one source language can be used by a main program written in
a different source language.  Using &lsquo;<samp class="samp">set language auto</samp>&rsquo; in this
case frees you from having to set the working language manually.
</p>
<p>The warning is enabled by default, but it can be controlled via a
setting:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a id="index-warn_002dlanguage_002dframe_002dmismatch"></a><span><code class="code">set warn-language-frame-mismatch [on|off]</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-warn_002dlanguage_002dframe_002dmismatch"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Enable or disable the warning that is issued when the current language
is set to a value that does not match the current frame.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">show warn-language-frame-mismatch</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show whether the frame-mismatch warning will be issued.
</p></dd>
</dl>
