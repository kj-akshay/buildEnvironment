<p>The Guile and Python extension languages do not share any state,
and generally do not interfere with each other.
There are some things to be aware of, however.
</p>
<ul class="mini-toc">
<li><a href="#Python-comes-first" accesskey="1">Python comes first</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Python-comes-first">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>23.6.1 Python comes first<a class="copiable-link" href="#Python-comes-first"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>Python was <small class="sc">GDB</small>&rsquo;s first extension language, and to avoid breaking
existing behavior Python comes first.  This is generally solved by the
&ldquo;first one wins&rdquo; principle.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> maintains a list of enabled
extension languages, and when it makes a call to an extension language,
(say to pretty-print a value), it tries each in turn until an extension
language indicates it has performed the request (e.g., has returned the
pretty-printed form of a value).
This extends to errors while performing such requests: If an error happens
while, for example, trying to pretty-print an object then the error is
reported and any following extension languages are not tried.
