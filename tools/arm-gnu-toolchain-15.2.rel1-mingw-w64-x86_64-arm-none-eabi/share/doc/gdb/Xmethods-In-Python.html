<p><em class="dfn">Xmethods</em> are additional methods or replacements for existing
methods of a C<code class="t">++</code> class.  This feature is useful for those cases
where a method defined in C<code class="t">++</code> source code could be inlined or
optimized out by the compiler, making it unavailable to <small class="sc">GDB</small>.
For such cases, one can define an xmethod to serve as a replacement
for the method defined in the C<code class="t">++</code> source code.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> will
then invoke the xmethod, instead of the C<code class="t">++</code> method, to
evaluate expressions.  One can also use xmethods when debugging
with core files.  Moreover, when debugging live programs, invoking an
xmethod need not involve running the inferior (which can potentially
perturb its state).  Hence, even if the C<code class="t">++</code> method is available, it
is better to use its replacement xmethod if one is defined.
</p>
<p>The xmethods feature in Python is available via the concepts of an
<em class="dfn">xmethod matcher</em> and an <em class="dfn">xmethod worker</em>.  To
implement an xmethod, one has to implement a matcher and a
corresponding worker for it (more than one worker can be
implemented, each catering to a different overloaded instance of the
method).  Internally, <small class="sc">GDB</small> invokes the <code class="code">match</code> method of a
matcher to match the class type and method name.  On a match, the
<code class="code">match</code> method returns a list of matching <em class="emph">worker</em> objects.
Each worker object typically corresponds to an overloaded instance of
the xmethod.  They implement a <code class="code">get_arg_types</code> method which
returns a sequence of types corresponding to the arguments the xmethod
requires.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> uses this sequence of types to perform
overload resolution and picks a winning xmethod worker.  A winner
is also selected from among the methods <small class="sc">GDB</small> finds in the
C<code class="t">++</code> source code.  Next, the winning xmethod worker and the
winning C<code class="t">++</code> method are compared to select an overall winner.  In
case of a tie between a xmethod worker and a C<code class="t">++</code> method, the
xmethod worker is selected as the winner.  That is, if a winning
xmethod worker is found to be equivalent to the winning C<code class="t">++</code>
method, then the xmethod worker is treated as a replacement for
the C<code class="t">++</code> method.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> uses the overall winner to invoke the
method.  If the winning xmethod worker is the overall winner, then
the corresponding xmethod is invoked via the <code class="code">__call__</code> method
of the worker object.
</p>
<p>If one wants to implement an xmethod as a replacement for an
existing C<code class="t">++</code> method, then they have to implement an equivalent
xmethod which has exactly the same name and takes arguments of
exactly the same type as the C<code class="t">++</code> method.  If the user wants to
invoke the C<code class="t">++</code> method even though a replacement xmethod is
available for that method, then they can disable the xmethod.
