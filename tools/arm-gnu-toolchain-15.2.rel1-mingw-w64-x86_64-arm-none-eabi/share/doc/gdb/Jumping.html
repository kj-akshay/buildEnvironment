<h3 class="section" id="Continuing-at-a-Different-Address"><span>17.2 Continuing at a Different Address<a class="copiable-link" href="#Continuing-at-a-Different-Address"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Ordinarily, when you continue your program, you do so at the place where
it stopped, with the <code class="code">continue</code> command.  You can instead continue at
an address of your own choosing, with the following commands:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-j-_0028jump_0029"></a>
<a id="index-jump"></a><span><code class="code">jump <var class="var">locspec</var></code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-jump"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dt><code class="code">j <var class="var">locspec</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Resume execution at the address of the code location that results from
resolving <var class="var">locspec</var>.
See <a class="xref" href="Location-Specifications.html">Location Specifications</a>, for a description of the different
forms of <var class="var">locspec</var>.  If <var class="var">locspec</var> resolves to more than one address,
those outside the current compilation unit are ignored.  If considering just
the addresses in the current compilation unit still doesn&rsquo;t yield a unique
address, the command aborts before jumping.
Execution stops again immediately if there is a breakpoint there.  It
is common practice to use the <code class="code">tbreak</code> command in conjunction
with <code class="code">jump</code>.  See <a class="xref" href="Set-Breaks.html">Setting Breakpoints</a>.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">jump</code> command does not change the current stack frame, or
the stack pointer, or the contents of any memory location or any
register other than the program counter.  If <var class="var">locspec</var> resolves to
an address in a different function from the one currently executing, the
results may be bizarre if the two functions expect different patterns
of arguments or of local variables.  For this reason, the <code class="code">jump</code>
command requests confirmation if the jump address is not in the
function currently executing.  However, even bizarre results are
predictable if you are well acquainted with the machine-language code
of your program.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>On many systems, you can get much the same effect as the <code class="code">jump</code>
command by storing a new value into the register <code class="code">$pc</code>.  The
difference is that this does not start your program running; it only
changes the address of where it <em class="emph">will</em> run when you continue.  For
example,
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">set $pc = 0x485
</pre></div>

<p>makes the next <code class="code">continue</code> command or stepping command execute at
address <code class="code">0x485</code>, rather than at the address where your program stopped.
See <a class="xref" href="Continuing-and-Stepping.html">Continuing and Stepping</a>.
</p>
<p>However, writing directly to <code class="code">$pc</code> will only change the value of
the program-counter register, while using <code class="code">jump</code> will ensure that
any additional auxiliary state is also updated.  For example, on
SPARC, <code class="code">jump</code> will update both <code class="code">$pc</code> and <code class="code">$npc</code>
registers prior to resuming execution.  When using the approach of
writing directly to <code class="code">$pc</code> it is your job to also update the
<code class="code">$npc</code> register.
</p>
<p>The most common occasion to use the <code class="code">jump</code> command is to back
up&mdash;perhaps with more breakpoints set&mdash;over a portion of a program
that has already executed, in order to examine its execution in more
detail.
