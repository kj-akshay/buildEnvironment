<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-init-file-name"></a>

<p>During startup (see <a class="pxref" href="Startup.html">What <small class="sc">GDB</small> Does During Startup</a>) <small class="sc">GDB</small> will execute commands
from several initialization files.  These initialization files use the
same syntax as <em class="dfn">command files</em> (see <a class="pxref" href="Command-Files.html">Command Files</a>) and are
processed by <small class="sc">GDB</small> in the same way.
</p>
<p>To display the list of initialization files loaded by <small class="sc">GDB</small> at
startup, in the order they will be loaded, you can use <kbd class="kbd">gdb
--help</kbd>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-early-initialization"></a>
<p>The <em class="dfn">early initialization</em> file is loaded very early in
<small class="sc">GDB</small>&rsquo;s initialization process, before the interpreter
(see <a class="pxref" href="Interpreters.html">Command Interpreters</a>) has been initialized, and before the default
target (see <a class="pxref" href="Targets.html">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>) is initialized.  Only <code class="code">set</code> or
<code class="code">source</code> commands should be placed into an early initialization
file, and the only <code class="code">set</code> commands that can be used are those that
control how <small class="sc">GDB</small> starts up.
</p>
<p>Commands that can be placed into an early initialization file will be
documented as such throughout this manual.  Any command that is not
documented as being suitable for an early initialization file should
instead be placed into a general initialization file.  Command files
passed to <code class="code">--early-init-command</code> or <code class="code">-eix</code> are also early
initialization files, with the same command restrictions.  Only
commands that can appear in an early initialization file should be
passed to <code class="code">--early-init-eval-command</code> or <code class="code">-eiex</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-general-initialization"></a>
<p>In contrast, the <em class="dfn">general initialization</em> files are processed
later, after <small class="sc">GDB</small> has finished its own internal initialization
process, any valid command can be used in these files.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-initialization-file"></a>
<p>Throughout the rest of this document the term <em class="dfn">initialization
file</em> refers to one of the general initialization files, not the early
initialization file.  Any discussion of the early initialization file
will specifically mention that it is the early initialization file
being discussed.
</p>
<p>As the system wide and home directory initialization files are
processed before most command line options, changes to settings
(e.g. &lsquo;<samp class="samp">set complaints</samp>&rsquo;) can affect subsequent processing of
command line options and operands.
</p>
<p>The following sections describe where <small class="sc">GDB</small> looks for the early
initialization and initialization files, and the order that the files
are searched for.
</p>
<ul class="mini-toc">
<li><a href="#Home-directory-early-initialization-files" accesskey="1">Home directory early initialization files</a></li>
<li><a href="#System-wide-initialization-files" accesskey="2">System wide initialization files</a></li>
<li><a href="#Home-directory-initialization-file" accesskey="3">Home directory initialization file</a></li>
<li><a href="#Local-directory-initialization-file" accesskey="4">Local directory initialization file</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="subsubsection-level-extent" id="Home-directory-early-initialization-files">
<h4 class="subsubsection"><span>2.1.4.1 Home directory early initialization files<a class="copiable-link" href="#Home-directory-early-initialization-files"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> initially looks for an early initialization file in the
users home directory<a class="footnote" id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  There are a number of locations that <small class="sc">GDB</small> will
search in the home directory, these locations are searched in order
and <small class="sc">GDB</small> will load the first file that it finds, and
subsequent locations will not be checked.
</p>
<p>On non-macOS hosts the locations searched are:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The file <samp class="file">gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code class="env">XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li><li>The file <samp class="file">.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to
by the environment variable <code class="env">HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li><li>The file <samp class="file">.gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code class="env">HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li></ul>

<p>By contrast, on macOS hosts the locations searched are:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The file <samp class="file">Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the
directory pointed to by the environment variable <code class="env">HOME</code>, if it is
defined.
</li><li>The file <samp class="file">.gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code class="env">HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li></ul>

<p>It is possible to prevent the home directory early initialization file
from being loaded using the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-nx</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-nh</samp>&rsquo; command line
options, see <a class="pxref" href="Mode-Options.html">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="System-Wide-Init-Files"></a></div>
<div class="subsubsection-level-extent" id="System-wide-initialization-files">
<h4 class="subsubsection"><span>2.1.4.2 System wide initialization files<a class="copiable-link" href="#System-wide-initialization-files"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>There are two locations that are searched for system wide
initialization files.  Both of these locations are always checked:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><code class="code"><samp class="file">system.gdbinit</samp></code></dt>
<dd><p>This is a single system-wide initialization file.  Its location is
specified with the <code class="code">--with-system-gdbinit</code> configure option
(see <a class="pxref" href="System_002dwide-configuration.html">System-wide configuration and settings</a>).  It is loaded first when
<small class="sc">GDB</small> starts, before command line options have been processed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code"><samp class="file">system.gdbinit.d</samp></code></dt>
<dd><p>This is the system-wide initialization directory.  Its location is
specified with the <code class="code">--with-system-gdbinit-dir</code> configure option
(see <a class="pxref" href="System_002dwide-configuration.html">System-wide configuration and settings</a>).  Files in this directory are
loaded in alphabetical order immediately after <samp class="file">system.gdbinit</samp>
(if enabled) when <small class="sc">GDB</small> starts, before command line options
have been processed.  Files need to have a recognized scripting
language extension (<samp class="file">.py</samp>/<samp class="file">.scm</samp>) or be named with a
<samp class="file">.gdb</samp> extension to be interpreted as regular <small class="sc">GDB</small>
commands.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> will not recurse into any subdirectories of
this directory.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is possible to prevent the system wide initialization files from
being loaded using the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-nx</samp>&rsquo; command line option, see <a class="pxref" href="Mode-Options.html">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="Home-Directory-Init-File"></a></div>
<div class="subsubsection-level-extent" id="Home-directory-initialization-file">
<h4 class="subsubsection"><span>2.1.4.3 Home directory initialization file<a class="copiable-link" href="#Home-directory-initialization-file"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-gdbinit"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_002egdbinit"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-gdb_002eini"></a>

<p>After loading the system wide initialization files <small class="sc">GDB</small> will
look for an initialization file in the users home
directory<a class="footnote" id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  There are a
number of locations that <small class="sc">GDB</small> will search in the home
directory, these locations are searched in order and <small class="sc">GDB</small> will
load the first file that it finds, and subsequent locations will not
be checked.
</p>
<p>On non-Apple hosts the locations searched are:
</p><dl class="table">
<dt><samp class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp class="file">$HOME/.config/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp class="file">$HOME/.gdbinit</samp></dt>
</dl>

<p>While on Apple hosts the locations searched are:
</p><dl class="table">
<dt><samp class="file">$HOME/Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp class="file">$HOME/.gdbinit</samp></dt>
</dl>

<p>It is possible to prevent the home directory initialization file from
being loaded using the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-nx</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-nh</samp>&rsquo; command line options,
see <a class="pxref" href="Mode-Options.html">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<p>The DJGPP port of <small class="sc">GDB</small> uses the name <samp class="file">gdb.ini</samp> instead of
<samp class="file">.gdbinit</samp> or <samp class="file">gdbinit</samp>, due to the limitations of file
names imposed by DOS filesystems.  The Windows port of <small class="sc">GDB</small>
uses the standard name, but if it finds a <samp class="file">gdb.ini</samp> file in your
home directory, it warns you about that and suggests to rename the
file to the standard name.
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="Init-File-in-the-Current-Directory-during-Startup"></a></div>
<div class="subsubsection-level-extent" id="Local-directory-initialization-file">
<h4 class="subsubsection"><span>2.1.4.4 Local directory initialization file<a class="copiable-link" href="#Local-directory-initialization-file"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> will check the current directory for a file called
<samp class="file">.gdbinit</samp>.  It is loaded last, after command line options
other than &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-x</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-ex</samp>&rsquo; have been processed.  The command
line options &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-x</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-ex</samp>&rsquo; are processed last, after
<samp class="file">.gdbinit</samp> has been loaded, see <a class="pxref" href="File-Options.html">Choosing
Files</a>.
</p>
<p>If the file in the current directory was already loaded as the home
directory initialization file then it will not be loaded a second
time.
</p>
<p>It is possible to prevent the local directory initialization file from
being loaded using the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-nx</samp>&rsquo; command line option, see <a class="pxref" href="Mode-Options.html">Choosing Modes</a>.
