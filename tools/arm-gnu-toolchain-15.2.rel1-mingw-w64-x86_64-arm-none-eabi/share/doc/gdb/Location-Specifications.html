<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-location-spec"></a>
<p>Several <small class="sc">GDB</small> commands accept arguments that specify a location
or locations of your program&rsquo;s code.  Many times locations are
specified using a source line number, but they can also be specified
by a function name, an address, a label, etc.  The different
forms of specifying a location that <small class="sc">GDB</small> recognizes are
collectively known as forms of <em class="dfn">location specification</em>, or
<em class="dfn">location spec</em>.  This section documents the forms of specifying
locations that <small class="sc">GDB</small> recognizes.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-location-resolution"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-resolution-of-location-spec"></a>
<p>When you specify a location, <small class="sc">GDB</small> needs to find the place in
your program, known as <em class="dfn">code location</em>, that corresponds to the
given location spec.  We call this process of finding actual code
locations corresponding to a location spec <em class="dfn">location resolution</em>.
</p>
<p>A concrete code location in your program is uniquely identifiable by a
set of several attributes: its source line number, the name of its
source file, the fully-qualified and prototyped function in which it
is defined, and an instruction address.  Because each inferior has its
own address space, the inferior number is also a necessary part of
these attributes.
</p>
<p>By contrast, location specs you type will many times omit some of
these attributes.  For example, it is customary to specify just the
source line number to mean a line in the current source file, or
specify just the basename of the file, omitting its directories.  In
other words, a location spec is usually incomplete, a kind of
blueprint, and <small class="sc">GDB</small> needs to complete the missing attributes
by using the implied defaults, and by considering the source code and
the debug information available to it.  This is what location
resolution is about.
</p>
<p>The resolution of an incomplete location spec can produce more than a
single code location, if the spec doesn&rsquo;t allow distinguishing between
them.  Here are some examples of situations that result in a location
spec matching multiple code locations in your program:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The location spec specifies a function name, and there are several
functions in the program which have that name.  (To distinguish
between them, you can specify a fully-qualified and prototyped
function name, such as <code class="code">A::func(int)</code> instead of just
<code class="code">func</code>.)

</li><li>The location spec specifies a source file name, and there are several
source files in the program that share the same name, for example
several files with the same basename in different subdirectories.  (To
distinguish between them, specify enough leading directories with the
file name.)

</li><li>For a C<code class="t">++</code> constructor, the <small class="sc">GCC</small> compiler generates several
instances of the function body, used in different cases, but their
source-level names are identical.

</li><li>For a C<code class="t">++</code> template function, a given line in the function can
correspond to any number of instantiations.

</li><li>For an inlined function, a given source line can correspond to several
actual code locations with that function&rsquo;s inlined code.
</li></ul>

<p>Resolution of a location spec can also fail to produce a complete code
location, or even fail to produce any code location.  Here are some
examples of such situations:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Some parts of the program lack detailed enough debug info, so the
resolved code location lacks some attributes, like source file name
and line number, leaving just the instruction address and perhaps also
a function name.  Such an incomplete code location is only usable in
contexts that work with addresses and/or function names.  Some
commands can only work with complete code locations.

</li><li>The location spec specifies a function name, and there are no
functions in the program by that name, or they only exist in a
yet-unloaded shared library.

</li><li>The location spec specifies a source file name, and there are no
source files in the program by that name, or they only exist in a
yet-unloaded shared library.

</li><li>The location spec specifies both a source file name and a source line
number, and even though there are source files in the program that
match the file name, none of those files has the specified line
number.
</li></ul>

<p>Locations may be specified using three different formats: linespec
locations, explicit locations, or address locations.  The following
subsections describe these formats.
