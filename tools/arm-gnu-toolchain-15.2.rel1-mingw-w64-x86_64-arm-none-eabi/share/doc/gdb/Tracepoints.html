<p>In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program&rsquo;s execution long enough for the developer to learn
anything helpful about its behavior.  If the program&rsquo;s correctness
depends on its real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger
might cause the program to change its behavior drastically, or perhaps
fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to be able
to observe the program&rsquo;s behavior without interrupting it.
</p>
<p>Using <small class="sc">GDB</small>&rsquo;s <code class="code">trace</code> and <code class="code">collect</code> commands, you can
specify locations in the program, called <em class="dfn">tracepoints</em>, and
arbitrary expressions to evaluate when those tracepoints are reached.
Later, using the <code class="code">tfind</code> command, you can examine the values
those expressions had when the program hit the tracepoints.  The
expressions may also denote objects in memory&mdash;structures or arrays,
for example&mdash;whose values <small class="sc">GDB</small> should record; while visiting
a particular tracepoint, you may inspect those objects as if they were
in memory at that moment.  However, because <small class="sc">GDB</small> records these
values without interacting with you, it can do so quickly and
unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing the program&rsquo;s behavior.
</p>
<p>The tracepoint facility is currently available only for remote
targets.  See <a class="xref" href="Targets.html">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>.  In addition, your remote target must know
how to collect trace data.  This functionality is implemented in the
remote stub; however, none of the stubs distributed with <small class="sc">GDB</small>
support tracepoints as of this writing.  The format of the remote
packets used to implement tracepoints are described in <a class="ref" href="Tracepoint-Packets.html">Tracepoint Packets</a>.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to get trace data from a file, in a manner reminiscent
of corefiles; you specify the filename, and use <code class="code">tfind</code> to search
through the file.  See <a class="xref" href="Trace-Files.html">Using Trace Files</a>, for more details.
</p>
<p>This chapter describes the tracepoint commands and features.
