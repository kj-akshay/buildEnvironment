<h4 class="subsection" id="Disabling-Breakpoints"><span>5.1.5 Disabling Breakpoints<a class="copiable-link" href="#Disabling-Breakpoints"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-enable_002fdisable-a-breakpoint"></a>
<p>Rather than deleting a breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint, you might
prefer to <em class="dfn">disable</em> it.  This makes the breakpoint inoperative as if
it had been deleted, but remembers the information on the breakpoint so
that you can <em class="dfn">enable</em> it again later.
</p>
<p>You disable and enable breakpoints, watchpoints, tracepoints, and catchpoints
with the <code class="code">enable</code> and <code class="code">disable</code> commands, optionally specifying
one or more breakpoint numbers as arguments.  Use <code class="code">info break</code> to print
a list of all breakpoints, watchpoints, tracepoints, and catchpoints if you
do not know which numbers to use.
</p>
<p>Disabling and enabling a breakpoint that has multiple locations
affects all of its locations.
</p>
<p>A breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint can have any of several
different states of enablement:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Enabled.  The breakpoint stops your program.  A breakpoint set
with the <code class="code">break</code> command starts out in this state.
</li><li>Disabled.  The breakpoint has no effect on your program.
</li><li>Enabled once.  The breakpoint stops your program, but then becomes
disabled.
</li><li>Enabled for a count.  The breakpoint stops your program for the next
N times, then becomes disabled.
</li><li>Enabled for deletion.  The breakpoint stops your program, but
immediately after it does so it is deleted permanently.  A breakpoint
set with the <code class="code">tbreak</code> command starts out in this state.
</li></ul>

<p>You can use the following commands to enable or disable breakpoints,
watchpoints, tracepoints, and catchpoints:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dis-_0028disable_0029"></a>
<a id="index-disable"></a><span><code class="code">disable <span class="r">[</span>breakpoints<span class="r">]</span> <span class="r">[</span><var class="var">list</var>&hellip;<span class="r">]</span></code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-disable"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Disable the specified breakpoints&mdash;or all breakpoints, if none are
listed.  A disabled breakpoint has no effect but is not forgotten.  All
options such as ignore-counts, conditions and commands are remembered in
case the breakpoint is enabled again later.  You may abbreviate
<code class="code">disable</code> as <code class="code">dis</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-enable"></a><span><code class="code">enable <span class="r">[</span>breakpoints<span class="r">]</span> <span class="r">[</span><var class="var">list</var>&hellip;<span class="r">]</span></code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-enable"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the specified breakpoints (or all defined breakpoints).  They
become effective once again in stopping your program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">enable <span class="r">[</span>breakpoints<span class="r">]</span> once <var class="var">list</var>&hellip;</code></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> disables any
of these breakpoints immediately after stopping your program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">enable <span class="r">[</span>breakpoints<span class="r">]</span> count <var class="var">count</var> <var class="var">list</var>&hellip;</code></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> records
<var class="var">count</var> with each of the specified breakpoints, and decrements a
breakpoint&rsquo;s count when it is hit.  When any count reaches 0,
<small class="sc">GDB</small> disables that breakpoint.  If a breakpoint has an ignore
count (see <a class="pxref" href="Conditions.html">Break Conditions</a>), that will be
decremented to 0 before <var class="var">count</var> is affected.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">enable <span class="r">[</span>breakpoints<span class="r">]</span> delete <var class="var">list</var>&hellip;</code></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the specified breakpoints to work once, then die.  <small class="sc">GDB</small>
deletes any of these breakpoints as soon as your program stops there.
Breakpoints set by the <code class="code">tbreak</code> command start out in this state.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Except for a breakpoint set with <code class="code">tbreak</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Set-Breaks.html">Setting Breakpoints</a>), breakpoints that you set are initially enabled;
subsequently, they become disabled or enabled only when you use one of
the commands above.  (The command <code class="code">until</code> can set and delete a
breakpoint of its own, but it does not change the state of your other
breakpoints; see <a class="ref" href="Continuing-and-Stepping.html">Continuing and
Stepping</a>.)
