<p>Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs-like
keybindings installed by default, it is possible to use a different set
of keybindings.
Any user can customize programs that use Readline by putting
commands in an <em class="dfn">inputrc</em> file,
conventionally in their home directory.
The name of this
file is taken from the value of the environment variable <code class="env">INPUTRC</code>.  If
that variable is unset, the default is <samp class="file">~/.inputrc</samp>.  If that
file does not exist or cannot be read, the ultimate default is
<samp class="file">/etc/inputrc</samp>.
</p>
<p>When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the
init file is read, and the key bindings are set.
</p>
<p>In addition, the <code class="code">C-x C-r</code> command re-reads this init file, thus
incorporating any changes that you might have made to it.
