<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-stop-reply-packets"></a>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">C</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">c</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">S</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">s</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">vCont</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">vAttach</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">vRun</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">vStopped</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; packets can
receive any of the below as a reply.  Except for &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">vStopped</samp>&rsquo;, that reply is only returned
when the target halts.  In the below the exact meaning of <em class="dfn">signal
number</em> is defined by the header <samp class="file">include/gdb/signals.h</samp> in the
<small class="sc">GDB</small> source code.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, the server will simply reply &lsquo;<samp class="samp">OK</samp>&rsquo; to commands
such as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">vCont</samp>&rsquo;; any stop will be the subject of a future
notification.  See <a class="xref" href="Remote-Non_002dStop.html">Remote Protocol Support for Non-Stop Mode</a>.
</p>
<p>As in the description of request packets, we include spaces in the
reply templates for clarity; these are not part of the reply packet&rsquo;s
syntax.  No <small class="sc">GDB</small> stop reply packet uses spaces to separate its
components.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">S <var class="var">AA</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The program received signal number <var class="var">AA</var> (a two-digit hexadecimal
number).  This is equivalent to a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">T</samp>&rsquo; response with no
<var class="var">n</var>:<var class="var">r</var> pairs.

<dd><p>The program received signal number <var class="var">AA</var> (a two-digit hexadecimal
number).  This is equivalent to an &lsquo;<samp class="samp">S</samp>&rsquo; response, except that the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp"><var class="var">n</var>:<var class="var">r</var></samp>&rsquo; pairs can carry values of important registers
and other information directly in the stop reply packet, reducing
round-trip latency.  Single-step and breakpoint traps are reported
this way.  Each &lsquo;<samp class="samp"><var class="var">n</var>:<var class="var">r</var></samp>&rsquo; pair is interpreted as follows:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>If <var class="var">n</var> is a hexadecimal number, it is a register number, and the
corresponding <var class="var">r</var> gives that register&rsquo;s value.  The data <var class="var">r</var> is a
series of bytes in target byte order, with each byte given by a
two-digit hex number.

</li><li>If <var class="var">n</var> is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">thread</samp>&rsquo;, then <var class="var">r</var> is the thread ID of
the stopped thread, as specified in <a class="ref" href="Packets.html#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a>.

</li><li>If <var class="var">n</var> is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">core</samp>&rsquo;, then <var class="var">r</var> is the hexadecimal number of
the core on which the stop event was detected.

</li><li>If <var class="var">n</var> is a recognized <em class="dfn">stop reason</em>, it describes a more
specific event that stopped the target.  The currently defined stop
reasons are listed below.  The <var class="var">aa</var> should be &lsquo;<samp class="samp">05</samp>&rsquo;, the trap
signal.  At most one stop reason should be present.

</li><li>Otherwise, <small class="sc">GDB</small> should ignore this &lsquo;<samp class="samp"><var class="var">n</var>:<var class="var">r</var></samp>&rsquo; pair
and go on to the next; this allows us to extend the protocol in the
future.
</li></ul>

<p>The currently defined stop reasons are:

<dd><p>The packet indicates that the target cannot continue replaying 
logged execution events, because it has reached the end (or the
beginning when executing backward) of the log.  The value of <var class="var">r</var>
will be either &lsquo;<samp class="samp">begin</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">end</samp>&rsquo;.  See <a class="xref" href="Reverse-Execution.html">Running programs backward</a>,

</p>
<p>On some architectures, such as x86, at the architecture level, when a
breakpoint instruction executes the program counter points at the
breakpoint address plus an offset.  On such targets, the stub is
responsible for adjusting the PC to point back at the breakpoint
address.
</p>
<p>This packet should not be sent by default; older <small class="sc">GDB</small> versions
did not support it.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> requests it, by supplying an
appropriate &lsquo;<samp class="samp">qSupported</samp>&rsquo; feature (see <a class="pxref" href="General-Query-Packets.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).  The
