<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Ada_002c-problems"></a>

<p>Besides the omissions listed previously (see <a class="pxref" href="Omissions-from-Ada.html">Omissions from Ada</a>),
we know of several problems with and limitations of Ada mode in
<small class="sc">GDB</small>,
some of which will be fixed with planned future releases of the debugger 
and the GNU Ada compiler.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Static constants that the compiler chooses not to materialize as objects in 
storage are invisible to the debugger.

</li><li>Named parameter associations in function argument lists are ignored (the
argument lists are treated as positional).

</li><li>Many useful library packages are currently invisible to the debugger.

</li><li>Fixed-point arithmetic, conversions, input, and output is carried out using 
floating-point arithmetic, and may give results that only approximate those on 
the host machine.

</li><li>The GNAT compiler never generates the prefix <code class="code">Standard</code> for any of 
the standard symbols defined by the Ada language.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> knows about 
this: it will strip the prefix from names when you use it, and will never
look for a name you have so qualified among local symbols, nor match against
symbols in other packages or subprograms.  If you have 
defined entities anywhere in your program other than parameters and 
local variables whose simple names match names in <code class="code">Standard</code>, 
GNAT&rsquo;s lack of qualification here can cause confusion.  When this happens,
you can usually resolve the confusion 
by qualifying the problematic names with package
<code class="code">Standard</code> explicitly.  
</li></ul>

<p>Older versions of the compiler sometimes generate erroneous debugging
information, resulting in the debugger incorrectly printing the value
of affected entities.  In some cases, the debugger is able to work
around an issue automatically. In other cases, the debugger is able
to work around the issue, but the work-around has to be specifically
enabled.

<dd><p>Configure GDB to strictly follow the GNAT encoding when computing the
value of Ada entities, particularly when <code class="code">PAD</code> and <code class="code">PAD___XVS</code>
types are involved (see <code class="code">ada/exp_dbug.ads</code> in the GCC sources for
a complete description of the encoding used by the GNAT compiler).
This is the default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">set ada trust-PAD-over-XVS off</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is related to the encoding using by the GNAT compiler.  If <small class="sc">GDB</small>
sometimes prints the wrong value for certain entities, changing <code class="code">ada
trust-PAD-over-XVS</code> to <code class="code">off</code> activates a work-around which may fix
the issue.  It is always safe to set <code class="code">ada trust-PAD-over-XVS</code> to
<code class="code">off</code>, but this incurs a slight performance penalty, so it is
recommended to leave this setting to <code class="code">on</code> unless necessary.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-GNAT-descriptive-types"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-GNAT-encoding"></a>
<p>Internally, the debugger also relies on the compiler following a number
of conventions known as the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">GNAT Encoding</samp>&rsquo;, all documented in
<samp class="file">gcc/ada/exp_dbug.ads</samp> in the GCC sources. This encoding describes
how the debugging information should be generated for certain types.
In particular, this convention makes use of <em class="dfn">descriptive types</em>,
which are artificial types generated purely to help the debugger.
</p>
<p>These encodings were defined at a time when the debugging information
format used was not powerful enough to describe some of the more complex
types available in Ada.  Since DWARF allows us to express nearly all
Ada features, the long-term goal is to slowly replace these descriptive
types by their pure DWARF equivalent.  To facilitate that transition,
a new maintenance option is available to force the debugger to ignore
those descriptive types.  It allows the user to quickly evaluate how
well <small class="sc">GDB</small> works without them.
