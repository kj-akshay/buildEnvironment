<h4 class="subsection" id="Breakpoint-Command-Lists"><span>5.1.7 Breakpoint Command Lists<a class="copiable-link" href="#Breakpoint-Command-Lists"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-breakpoint-commands"></a>
<p>You can give any breakpoint (or watchpoint or catchpoint) a series of
commands to execute when your program stops due to that breakpoint.  For
example, you might want to print the values of certain expressions, or
enable other breakpoints.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-end-_0028breakpoint-commands_0029"></a>
<a id="index-commands"></a><span><code class="code">commands <span class="r">[</span><var class="var">list</var>&hellip;<span class="r">]</span></code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-commands"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dt><code class="code">&hellip; <var class="var">command-list</var> &hellip;</code></dt>
<dt><code class="code">end</code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify a list of commands for the given breakpoints.  The commands
themselves appear on the following lines.  Type a line containing just
<code class="code">end</code> to terminate the commands.
</p>
<p>To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type <code class="code">commands</code> and
follow it immediately with <code class="code">end</code>; that is, give no commands.
</p>
<p>With no argument, <code class="code">commands</code> refers to the last breakpoint,
watchpoint, or catchpoint set (not to the breakpoint most recently
encountered).  If the most recent breakpoints were set with a single
command, then the <code class="code">commands</code> will apply to all the breakpoints
set by that command.  This applies to breakpoints set by
<code class="code">rbreak</code>, and also applies when a single <code class="code">break</code> command
creates multiple breakpoints (see <a class="pxref" href="Ambiguous-Expressions.html">Ambiguous
Expressions</a>).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Pressing <kbd class="key">RET</kbd> as a means of repeating the last <small class="sc">GDB</small> command is
disabled within a <var class="var">command-list</var>.
</p>
<p>Inside a command list, you can use the command
<kbd class="kbd">disable $_hit_bpnum</kbd> to disable the encountered breakpoint.
</p>
<p>If your breakpoint has several code locations, the command
<kbd class="kbd">disable $_hit_bpnum.$_hit_locno</kbd> will disable the specific breakpoint
code location encountered.  If the breakpoint has only one location,
this command will disable the encountered breakpoint.
</p>
<p>You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again.  Simply
use the <code class="code">continue</code> command, or <code class="code">step</code>, or any other command
that resumes execution.
</p>
<p>Any other commands in the command list, after a command that resumes
execution, are ignored.  This is because any time you resume execution
(even with a simple <code class="code">next</code> or <code class="code">step</code>), you may encounter
another breakpoint&mdash;which could have its own command list, leading to
ambiguities about which list to execute.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-silent"></a>
<p>If the first command you specify in a command list is <code class="code">silent</code>, the
usual message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This may
be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific message and
then continue.  If none of the remaining commands print anything, you
see no sign that the breakpoint was reached.  <code class="code">silent</code> is
meaningful only at the beginning of a breakpoint command list.
</p>
<p>The commands <code class="code">echo</code>, <code class="code">output</code>, and <code class="code">printf</code> allow you to
print precisely controlled output, and are often useful in silent
breakpoints.  See <a class="xref" href="Output.html">Commands for Controlled Output</a>.
</p>
<p>For example, here is how you could use breakpoint commands to print the
value of <code class="code">x</code> at entry to <code class="code">foo</code> whenever <code class="code">x</code> is positive.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">break foo if x&gt;0
commands
silent
printf &quot;x is %d\n&quot;,x
cont
end
</pre></div>

<p>One application for breakpoint commands is to compensate for one bug so
you can test for another.  Put a breakpoint just after the erroneous line
of code, give it a condition to detect the case in which something
erroneous has been done, and give it commands to assign correct values
to any variables that need them.  End with the <code class="code">continue</code> command
so that your program does not stop, and start with the <code class="code">silent</code>
command so that no output is produced.  Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">break 403
commands
silent
set x = y + 4
cont
end
</pre></div>
