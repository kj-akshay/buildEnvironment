<p>After the tracepoint experiment ends, you use <small class="sc">GDB</small> commands
for examining the trace data.  The basic idea is that each tracepoint
collects a trace <em class="dfn">snapshot</em> every time it is hit and another
snapshot every time it single-steps.  All these snapshots are
consecutively numbered from zero and go into a buffer, and you can
examine them later.  The way you examine them is to <em class="dfn">focus</em> on a
specific trace snapshot.  When the remote stub is focused on a trace
snapshot, it will respond to all <small class="sc">GDB</small> requests for memory and
registers by reading from the buffer which belongs to that snapshot,
rather than from <em class="emph">real</em> memory or registers of the program being
debugged.  This means that <strong class="strong">all</strong> <small class="sc">GDB</small> commands
(<code class="code">print</code>, <code class="code">info registers</code>, <code class="code">backtrace</code>, etc.) will
behave as if we were currently debugging the program state as it was
when the tracepoint occurred.  Any requests for data that are not in
the buffer will fail.
