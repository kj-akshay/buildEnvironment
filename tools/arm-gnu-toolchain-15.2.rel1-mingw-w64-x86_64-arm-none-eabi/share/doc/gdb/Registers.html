<p>You can refer to machine register contents, in expressions, as variables

<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> has four &ldquo;standard&rdquo; register names that are available (in
expressions) on most machines&mdash;whenever they do not conflict with an
architecture&rsquo;s canonical mnemonics for registers.  The register names
<code class="code">$pc</code> and <code class="code">$sp</code> are used for the program counter register and
the stack pointer.  <code class="code">$fp</code> is used for a register that contains a
pointer to the current stack frame, and <code class="code">$ps</code> is used for a
register that contains the processor status.  For example,
you could print the program counter in hex with
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">p/x $pc
</pre></div>

<p>or print the instruction to be executed next with
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">x/i $pc
</pre></div>

<p>or add four to the stack pointer<a class="footnote" id="DOCF12" href="#FOOT12"><sup>12</sup></a> with
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">set $sp += 4
</pre></div>

<p>Whenever possible, these four standard register names are available on
your machine even though the machine has different canonical mnemonics,
so long as there is no conflict.  The <code class="code">info registers</code> command
shows the canonical names.  For example, on the SPARC, <code class="code">info
registers</code> displays the processor status register as <code class="code">$psr</code> but you
can also refer to it as <code class="code">$ps</code>; and on x86-based machines <code class="code">$ps</code>
is an alias for the <small class="sc">EFLAGS</small> register.
</p>
<p><small class="sc">GDB</small> always considers the contents of an ordinary register as an
integer when the register is examined in this way.  Some machines have
special registers which can hold nothing but floating point; these
registers are considered to have floating point values.  There is no way
to refer to the contents of an ordinary register as floating point value
(although you can <em class="emph">print</em> it as a floating point value with
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">print/f $<var class="var">regname</var></samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>Some registers have distinct &ldquo;raw&rdquo; and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; data formats.  This
means that the data format in which the register contents are saved by
the operating system is not the same one that your program normally
sees.  For example, the registers of the 68881 floating point
coprocessor are always saved in &ldquo;extended&rdquo; (raw) format, but all C
programs expect to work with &ldquo;double&rdquo; (virtual) format.  In such
cases, <small class="sc">GDB</small> normally works with the virtual format only (the format
that makes sense for your program), but the <code class="code">info registers</code> command
prints the data in both formats.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-SSE-registers-_0028x86_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-MMX-registers-_0028x86_0029"></a>
<p>Some machines have special registers whose contents can be interpreted
in several different ways.  For example, modern x86-based machines
have SSE and MMX registers that can hold several values packed
together in several different formats.  <small class="sc">GDB</small> refers to such
registers in <code class="code">struct</code> notation:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(gdb) print $xmm1
$1 = {
  v4_float = {0, 3.43859137e-038, 1.54142831e-044, 1.821688e-044},
  v2_double = {9.92129282474342e-303, 2.7585945287983262e-313},
  v16_int8 = &quot;\000\000\000\000\3706;\001\v\000\000\000\r\000\000&quot;,
  v8_int16 = {0, 0, 14072, 315, 11, 0, 13, 0},
  v4_int32 = {0, 20657912, 11, 13},
  v2_int64 = {88725056443645952, 55834574859},
  uint128 = 0x0000000d0000000b013b36f800000000
}
</pre></div>

<p>To set values of such registers, you need to tell <small class="sc">GDB</small> which
view of the register you wish to change, as if you were assigning
value to a <code class="code">struct</code> member:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted"> (gdb) set $xmm1.uint128 = 0x000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFF
</pre></div>

<p>Normally, register values are relative to the selected stack frame
(see <a class="pxref" href="Selection.html">Selecting a Frame</a>).  This means that you get the
value that the register would contain if all stack frames farther in
were exited and their saved registers restored.  In order to see the
true contents of hardware registers, you must select the innermost
frame (with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">frame 0</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-caller_002dsaved-registers"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-call_002dclobbered-registers"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-volatile-registers"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_003cnot-saved_003e-values"></a>
<p>Usually ABIs reserve some registers as not needed to be saved by the
callee (a.k.a.: &ldquo;caller-saved&rdquo;, &ldquo;call-clobbered&rdquo; or &ldquo;volatile&rdquo;
registers).  It may therefore not be possible for <small class="sc">GDB</small> to know
the value a register had before the call (in other words, in the outer
frame), if the register value has since been changed by the callee.
<small class="sc">GDB</small> tries to deduce where the inner frame saved
(&ldquo;callee-saved&rdquo;) registers, from the debug info, unwind info, or the
machine code generated by your compiler.  If some register is not
saved, and <small class="sc">GDB</small> knows the register is &ldquo;caller-saved&rdquo; (via
its own knowledge of the ABI, or because the debug/unwind info
explicitly says the register&rsquo;s value is undefined), <small class="sc">GDB</small>
displays &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;not&nbsp;saved&gt;</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> as the register&rsquo;s value.  With targets
that <small class="sc">GDB</small> has no knowledge of the register saving convention,
if a register was not saved by the callee, then its value and location
in the outer frame are assumed to be the same of the inner frame.
This is usually harmless, because if the register is call-clobbered,
the caller either does not care what is in the register after the
call, or has code to restore the value that it does care about.  Note,
however, that if you change such a register in the outer frame, you
may also be affecting the inner frame.  Also, the more &ldquo;outer&rdquo; the
frame is you&rsquo;re looking at, the more likely a call-clobbered
register&rsquo;s value is to be wrong, in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t actually
represent the value the register had just before the call.

<p>This is a way of removing
one word from the stack, on machines where stacks grow downward in
memory (most machines, nowadays).  This assumes that the innermost
stack frame is selected; setting <code class="code">$sp</code> is not allowed when other
stack frames are selected.  To pop entire frames off the stack,
regardless of machine architecture, use <code class="code">return</code>;
