<p>If you replace or delete a part of the program but want to keep the old
code around for future reference, you often cannot simply comment it
out.  Block comments do not nest, so the first comment inside the old
code will end the commenting-out.  The probable result is a flood of
syntax errors.
</p>
<p>One way to avoid this problem is to use an always-false conditional
instead.  For instance, put <code class="code">#if 0</code> before the deleted code and
<code class="code">#endif</code> after it.  This works even if the code being turned
off contains conditionals, but they must be entire conditionals
(balanced &lsquo;<samp class="samp">#if</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">#endif</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>Some people use <code class="code">#ifdef notdef</code> instead.  This is risky, because
<code class="code">notdef</code> might be accidentally defined as a macro, and then the
conditional would succeed.  <code class="code">#if 0</code> can be counted on to fail.
</p>
<p>Do not use <code class="code">#if 0</code> for comments which are not C code.  Use a real
comment, instead.  The interior of <code class="code">#if 0</code> must consist of complete
tokens; in particular, single-quote characters must balance.  Comments
often contain unbalanced single-quote characters (known in English as
apostrophes).  These confuse <code class="code">#if 0</code>.  They don&rsquo;t confuse
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">/*</samp>&rsquo;.
