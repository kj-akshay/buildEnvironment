<p>The header files declaring interfaces to the operating system and
runtime libraries often cannot be written in strictly conforming C.
Therefore, GCC gives code found in <em class="dfn">system headers</em> special
treatment.  All warnings, other than those generated by &lsquo;<samp class="samp">#warning</samp>&rsquo;
(see <a class="pxref" href="Diagnostics.html">Diagnostics</a>), are suppressed while GCC is processing a system
header.  Macros defined in a system header are immune to a few warnings
wherever they are expanded.  This immunity is granted on an ad-hoc
basis, when we find that a warning generates lots of false positives
because of code in macros defined in system headers.
</p>
<p>Normally, only the headers found in specific directories are considered
system headers.  These directories are determined when GCC is compiled.
There are, however, two ways to make normal headers into system headers:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Header files found in directories added to the search path with the 
<samp class="option">-isystem</samp> and <samp class="option">-idirafter</samp> command-line options are 
treated as system headers for the purposes of diagnostics.

</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_0023pragma-GCC-system_005fheader"></a>
There is also a directive, <code class="code">#pragma&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;system_header<!-- /@w --></code>, which
tells GCC to consider the rest of the current include file a system
header, no matter where it was found.  Code that comes before the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">#pragma</samp>&rsquo; in the file is not affected.  <code class="code">#pragma&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;system_header<!-- /@w --></code> has no effect in the primary source file.
</li></ul>

<p>On some targets, such as RS/6000 AIX, GCC implicitly surrounds all
system headers with an &lsquo;<samp class="samp">extern &quot;C&quot;</samp>&rsquo; block when compiling as C++.
