<p>GCC provides a very large number of implicitly-declared built-in
functions that are typically inlined by the compiler.  Some of these
builtins directly correspond to standard library routines.  Some are
for internal use in the processing of exceptions or variable-length
argument lists and are not documented here because they may change
from time to time; we do not recommend general use of these functions.
</p>
<p>The remaining functions are provided either for optimization purposes, or
to expose low-level functionality needed to implement
features provided by library functions or similar &ldquo;glue&rdquo; between GCC
and other programming languages or libraries.  Others are
target-specific, providing direct access to instructions that have no
direct C equivalents without the need to write assembly language.  There
are also builtins to support various kinds of runtime error checking.
</p>
<p>Most builtins have names prefixed with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">__builtin_</samp>&rsquo;, although not
all of them use this convention.  Except as otherwise documented, all
built-in functions are available from any of the C family languages
supported by GCC.
</p>
<p>With the exception of built-ins that have library equivalents such as
the standard C library functions discussed below in <a class="ref" href="Library-Builtins.html">Builtins for C Library Functions</a>,
or that expand to
library calls, GCC built-in functions are always expanded inline and
thus do not have corresponding entry points and their address cannot
be obtained.  Attempting to use them in an expression other than
a function call results in a compile-time error.
