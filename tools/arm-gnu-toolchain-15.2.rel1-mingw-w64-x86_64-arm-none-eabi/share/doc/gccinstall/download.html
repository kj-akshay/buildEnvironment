<p>GCC is distributed via <a class="uref" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git.html">git</a> and via
HTTPS as tarballs compressed with <code class="command">gzip</code> or <code class="command">bzip2</code>.
</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a class="uref" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html">releases web page</a>
for information on how to obtain GCC.
</p>
<p>The source distribution includes the Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, COBOL
(GCC 15 and later), D (GCC 9 and later), Fortran, Go, and Modula-2
(GCC 13 and later) compilers, as well as runtime libraries for C++,
Objective-C, COBOL, and Fortran.  For previous versions these were
downloadable as separate components such as the core GCC distribution,
which included the C language front end and shared components, and
language-specific distributions including the language front end and
the language runtime (where appropriate).
</p>
<p>If you also intend to build binutils (either to upgrade an existing
installation or for use in place of the corresponding tools of your
OS), unpack the binutils distribution either in the same directory or
a separate one.  In the latter case, add symbolic links to any
components of the binutils you intend to build alongside the compiler
(<samp class="file">bfd</samp>, <samp class="file">binutils</samp>, <samp class="file">gas</samp>, <samp class="file">gprof</samp>, <samp class="file">ld</samp>,
<samp class="file">opcodes</samp>, &hellip;) to the directory containing the GCC sources.
</p>
<p>Likewise the GMP, MPFR, MPC and Gettext libraries can be automatically
built together with GCC.  You may simply run the
<code class="command">contrib/download_prerequisites</code> script in the GCC source directory
to set up everything.
Otherwise unpack the GMP, MPFR, MPC and/or Gettext source
distributions in the directory containing the GCC sources and rename
their directories to <samp class="file">gmp</samp>, <samp class="file">mpfr</samp>, <samp class="file">mpc</samp> and
<samp class="file">gettext</samp>, respectively (or use symbolic links with the same name).
