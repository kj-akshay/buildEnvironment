<p>GCC requires that various tools and packages be available for use in the
build procedure.  Modifying GCC sources requires additional tools
described below.
</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="Tools_002fpackages-necessary-for-building-GCC"><span>Tools/packages necessary for building GCC<a class="copiable-link" href="#Tools_002fpackages-necessary-for-building-GCC"> &para;</a></span></h3>
<dl class="table">
<dt>ISO C++14 compiler</dt>
<dd><p>Necessary to bootstrap GCC.  GCC 5.4 or newer has sufficient support
for used C++14 features.
</p>
<p>Versions of GCC prior to 15 allow bootstrapping with an ISO C++11
compiler, versions prior to 10.5 allow bootstrapping with an ISO C++98
compiler, and versions prior to 4.8 allow bootstrapping with an ISO
C89 compiler.
</p>
<p>If you need to build an intermediate version of GCC in order to
bootstrap current GCC, consider GCC 9.5: it can build the current Ada
and D compilers, and was also the version that declared C++17 support
stable.
</p>
<p>To build all languages in a cross-compiler or other configuration where
3-stage bootstrap is not performed, you need to start with an existing
GCC binary (of a new enough version) because source code for language
frontends other than C might use GCC extensions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>C standard library and headers</dt>
<dd>
<p>In order to build GCC, the C standard library and headers must be present
for all target variants for which target libraries will be built (and not
only the variant of the host C++ compiler).
</p>
<p>This affects the popular &lsquo;<samp class="samp">x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</samp>&rsquo; platform (among
other multilib targets), for which 64-bit (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">x86_64</samp>&rsquo;) and 32-bit
(&lsquo;<samp class="samp">i386</samp>&rsquo;) libc headers are usually packaged separately. If you do a
build of a native compiler on &lsquo;<samp class="samp">x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</samp>&rsquo;, make sure you
either have the 32-bit libc developer package properly installed (the exact
name of the package depends on your distro) or you must build GCC as a
64-bit only compiler by configuring with the option
<samp class="option">--disable-multilib</samp>.  Otherwise, you may encounter an error such as
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">fatal error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file</samp>&rsquo;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Python</dt>
<dd><p>If you configure a RISC-V compiler with the option <samp class="option">--with-arch</samp> and
the specified architecture string is non-canonical, then you will need
<code class="command">python</code> installed on the build system.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="anchor" id="GNAT-prerequisite"></a>GNAT</dt>
<dd>
<p>In order to build GNAT, the Ada compiler, you need a working GNAT
compiler (GCC version 5.1 or later).
</p>
<p>This includes GNAT tools such as <code class="command">gnatmake</code> and
<code class="command">gnatlink</code>, since the Ada front end is written in Ada and
uses some GNAT-specific extensions.
</p>
<p>In order to build a cross compiler, it is strongly recommended to install
the new compiler as native first, and then use it to build the cross
compiler. Other native compiler versions may work but this is not guaranteed and
will typically fail with hard to understand compilation errors during the
build.
</p>
<p>Similarly, it is strongly recommended to use an older version of GNAT to build
GNAT. More recent versions of GNAT than the version built are not guaranteed
to work and will often fail during the build with compilation errors.
</p>
<p>Note that <code class="command">configure</code> does not test whether the GNAT installation works
and has a sufficiently recent version; if too old a GNAT version is
installed and <samp class="option">--enable-languages=ada</samp> is used, the build will fail.
</p>
<p><code class="env">ADA_INCLUDE_PATH</code> and <code class="env">ADA_OBJECT_PATH</code> environment variables
must not be set when building the Ada compiler, the Ada tools, or the
Ada runtime libraries. You can check that your build environment is clean
by verifying that &lsquo;<samp class="samp">gnatls -v</samp>&rsquo; lists only one explicit path in each
section.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-cobol"></a><span><a class="anchor" id="GCOBOL-prerequisite"></a>GCOBOL<a class="copiable-link" href="#index-cobol"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The COBOL compiler, gcobol, first appeared in GCC 15.  To build the
COBOL parser, you need GNU Bison 3.5.1 or later (but not 3.8.0). To build
the lexer requires GNU Flex 2.6.4, the current version as of this writing,
released on 2017-05-06.
</p>
<p>The gcobol documentation is maintained as manpages using troff
mdoc. GNU groff is required to convert them to PDF format.  Conversion
to HTML is done with mandoc, available at
<a class="uref" href="http://mdocml.bsd.lv/">http://mdocml.bsd.lv/</a>.
</p>
<p>Because ISO COBOL defines strict requirements for numerical precision,
gcobol requires hardware with 128-bit computation instructions.  This
requirement applies to both host and target. For integer and
fixed-point computation, gcobol uses
</p><dl class="first-deftp">
<dt class="deftp" id="index-_005f_005fint128"><span class="category-def">Data type: </span><span><strong class="def-name">__int128</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_005f_005fint128"> &para;</a></span></dt>
</dl>
<p>meaning <code class="code">16 == sizeof(long long int)</code>.
For floating point, gcobol uses
</p><dl class="first-deftp">
<dt class="deftp" id="index-_005fFloat128"><span class="category-def">Data type: </span><span><strong class="def-name">_Float128</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_005fFloat128"> &para;</a></span></dt>
</dl>
<p>(On some architectures, GCC supports 128-bit floating point in software.)
</p>
<p>gcobol has so far been tested on two architectures only: x86_64 and
aarch64 with little-endian encoding.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="anchor" id="GDC-prerequisite"></a>GDC</dt>
<dd>
<p>In order to build GDC, the D compiler, you need a working GDC compiler
(GCC version 9.4 or later) and D runtime library, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">libphobos</samp>&rsquo;, as
the D front end is written in D.
</p>
<p>Versions of GDC prior to 12 can be built with an ISO C++11 compiler, which can
then be installed and used to bootstrap newer versions of the D front end.
</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to use an older version of GDC to build GDC. More
recent versions of GDC than the version built are not guaranteed to work and
will often fail during the build with compilation errors relating to
deprecations or removed features.
</p>
<p>Note that <code class="command">configure</code> does not test whether the GDC installation works
and has a sufficiently recent version.  Though the implementation of the D
front end does not make use of any GDC-specific extensions, or novel features
of the D language, if too old a GDC version is installed and
<samp class="option">--enable-languages=d</samp> is used, the build will fail.
</p>
<p>On some targets, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">libphobos</samp>&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t enabled by default, but compiles
and works if <samp class="option">--enable-libphobos</samp> is used.  Specifics are
documented for affected targets.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="anchor" id="GM2-prerequisite"></a>GM2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Python3 is required if you want to build the complete Modula-2
documentation including the target <code class="code">SYSTEM</code> definition module.
If Python3 is unavailable Modula-2 documentation will include a target
independent version of the SYSTEM modules.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="anchor" id="gccrs-prerequisite"></a>gccrs</dt>
<dd>
<p>The official Rust compiler and Rust build system (cargo) are required for
building various parts of the gccrs frontend, until gccrs can compile them
by itself. The minimum supported Rust version is 1.49.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>A &ldquo;working&rdquo; POSIX compatible shell, or GNU bash</dt>
<dd>
<p>Necessary when running <code class="command">configure</code> because some
<code class="command">/bin/sh</code> shells have bugs and may crash when configuring the
target libraries.  In other cases, <code class="command">/bin/sh</code> or <code class="command">ksh</code>
have disastrous corner-case performance problems.  This
can cause target <code class="command">configure</code> runs to literally take days to
complete in some cases.
</p>
<p>So on some platforms <code class="command">/bin/ksh</code> is sufficient, on others it
isn&rsquo;t.  See the host/target specific instructions for your platform, or
use <code class="command">bash</code> to be sure.  Then set <code class="env">CONFIG_SHELL</code> in your
environment to your &ldquo;good&rdquo; shell prior to running
<code class="command">configure</code>/<code class="command">make</code>.
</p>
<p><code class="command">zsh</code> is not a fully compliant POSIX shell and will not
work when configuring GCC.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GNU flex</dt>
<dd>
<p>Necessary to build the lexical analysis module.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>A POSIX or SVR4 awk</dt>
<dd>
<p>Necessary for creating some of the generated source files for GCC.
If in doubt, use a recent GNU awk version.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GNU binutils</dt>
<dd>
<p>Necessary in some circumstances, optional in others.  See the
host/target specific instructions for your platform for the exact
requirements.
</p>
<p>Note binutils 2.35 or newer is required for LTO to work correctly
with GNU libtool that includes doing a bootstrap with LTO enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>gzip version 1.2.4 (or later) or</dt>
<dt>bzip2 version 1.0.2 (or later)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Necessary to uncompress GCC <code class="command">tar</code> files when source code is
obtained via HTTPS mirror sites.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GNU make version 3.80 (or later)</dt>
<dd>
<p>You must have GNU make installed to build GCC.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GNU tar version 1.14 (or later)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Necessary (only on some platforms) to untar the source code.  Many
systems&rsquo; <code class="command">tar</code> programs will also work, only try GNU
<code class="command">tar</code> if you have problems.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Perl version 5.6.1 (or later)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Necessary when targeting Darwin, building &lsquo;<samp class="samp">libstdc++</samp>&rsquo;,
and not using <samp class="option">--disable-symvers</samp>.
Necessary when targeting Solaris with Solaris <code class="command">ld</code> and not using
<samp class="option">--disable-symvers</samp>.
</p>
<p>Necessary when regenerating <samp class="file">Makefile</samp> dependencies in libiberty.
Necessary when regenerating <samp class="file">libiberty/functions.texi</samp>.
Necessary when generating manpages from Texinfo manuals.
Used by various scripts to generate some files included in the source
repository (mainly Unicode-related and rarely changing) from source
tables.
</p>
<p>Used by <code class="command">automake</code>.
</p>
<p>If available, enables parallel testing of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">libgomp</samp>&rsquo; in case that
<code class="command">flock</code> is not available.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Several support libraries are necessary to build GCC, some are required,
others optional.  While any sufficiently new version of required tools
usually work, library requirements are generally stricter.  Newer
versions may work in some cases, but it&rsquo;s safer to use the exact
versions documented.  We appreciate bug reports about problems with
newer versions, though.  If your OS vendor provides packages for the
support libraries then using those packages may be the simplest way to
install the libraries.
