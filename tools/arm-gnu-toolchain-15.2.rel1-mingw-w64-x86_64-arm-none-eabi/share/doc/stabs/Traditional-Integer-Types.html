<p>Often types are defined as subranges of themselves.  If the bounding values
fit within an <code class="code">int</code>, then they are given normally.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">.stabs &quot;int:t1=r1;-2147483648;2147483647;&quot;,128,0,0,0    # <span class="r">128 is N_LSYM</span>
.stabs &quot;char:t2=r2;0;127;&quot;,128,0,0,0
</pre></div>

<p>Builtin types can also be described as subranges of <code class="code">int</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">.stabs &quot;unsigned short:t6=r1;0;65535;&quot;,128,0,0,0
</pre></div>

<p>If the lower bound of a subrange is 0 and the upper bound is -1,
the type is an unsigned integral type whose bounds are too
big to describe in an <code class="code">int</code>.  Traditionally this is only used for
<code class="code">unsigned int</code> and <code class="code">unsigned long</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">.stabs &quot;unsigned int:t4=r1;0;-1;&quot;,128,0,0,0
</pre></div>

<p>For larger types, GCC 2.4.5 puts out bounds in octal, with one or more
leading zeroes.  In this case a negative bound consists of a number
which is a 1 bit (for the sign bit) followed by a 0 bit for each bit in
the number (except the sign bit), and a positive bound is one which is a
1 bit for each bit in the number (except possibly the sign bit).  All
known versions of dbx and GDB version 4 accept this (at least in the
sense of not refusing to process the file), but GDB 3.5 refuses to read
the whole file containing such symbols.  So GCC 2.3.3 did not output the
proper size for these types.  As an example of octal bounds, the string
fields of the stabs for 64 bit integer types look like:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">long int:t3=r1;001000000000000000000000;000777777777777777777777;
long unsigned int:t5=r1;000000000000000000000000;001777777777777777777777;
</pre></div>

<p>If the lower bound of a subrange is 0 and the upper bound is negative,
the type is an unsigned integral type whose size in bytes is the
absolute value of the upper bound.  I believe this is a Convex
convention for <code class="code">unsigned long long</code>.
</p>
<p>If the lower bound of a subrange is negative and the upper bound is 0,
the type is a signed integral type whose size in bytes is
the absolute value of the lower bound.  I believe this is a Convex
convention for <code class="code">long long</code>.  To distinguish this from a legitimate
subrange, the type should be a subrange of itself.  I&rsquo;m not sure whether
this is the case for Convex.
