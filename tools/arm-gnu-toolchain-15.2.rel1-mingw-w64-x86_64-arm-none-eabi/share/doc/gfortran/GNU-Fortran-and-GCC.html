<p>GNU Fortran is a part of GCC, the <em class="dfn">GNU Compiler Collection</em>.  GCC
consists of a collection of front ends for various languages, which
translate the source code into a language-independent form called
<em class="dfn">GENERIC</em>.  This is then processed by a common middle end which
provides optimization, and then passed to one of a collection of back
ends which generate code for different computer architectures and
operating systems.
</p>
<p>Functionally, this is implemented with a driver program (<code class="command">gcc</code>)
which provides the command-line interface for the compiler.  It calls
the relevant compiler front-end program (e.g., <code class="command">f951</code> for
Fortran) for each file in the source code, and then calls the assembler
and linker as appropriate to produce the compiled output.  In a copy of
GCC that has been compiled with Fortran language support enabled,
<code class="command">gcc</code> recognizes files with <samp class="file">.f</samp>, <samp class="file">.for</samp>, <samp class="file">.ftn</samp>,
<samp class="file">.f90</samp>, <samp class="file">.f95</samp>, <samp class="file">.f03</samp> and <samp class="file">.f08</samp> extensions as
Fortran source code, and compiles it accordingly.  A <code class="command">gfortran</code>
driver program is also provided, which is identical to <code class="command">gcc</code>
except that it automatically links the Fortran runtime libraries into the
compiled program.
</p>
<p>Source files with <samp class="file">.f</samp>, <samp class="file">.for</samp>, <samp class="file">.fpp</samp>, <samp class="file">.ftn</samp>, <samp class="file">.F</samp>,
<samp class="file">.FOR</samp>, <samp class="file">.FPP</samp>, and <samp class="file">.FTN</samp> extensions are treated as fixed form.
Source files with <samp class="file">.f90</samp>, <samp class="file">.f95</samp>, <samp class="file">.f03</samp>, <samp class="file">.f08</samp>,
<samp class="file">.F90</samp>, <samp class="file">.F95</samp>, <samp class="file">.F03</samp> and <samp class="file">.F08</samp> extensions are
treated as free form.  The capitalized versions of either form are run
through preprocessing.  Source files with the lower case <samp class="file">.fpp</samp>
extension are also run through preprocessing.
</p>
<p>This manual specifically documents the Fortran front end, which handles
the programming language&rsquo;s syntax and semantics.  The aspects of GCC
that relate to the optimization passes and the back-end code generation
are documented in the GCC manual; see
<a data-manual="gcc" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/index.html#Top">Introduction</a> in <cite class="cite">Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</cite>.
The two manuals together provide a complete reference for the GNU
Fortran compiler.
