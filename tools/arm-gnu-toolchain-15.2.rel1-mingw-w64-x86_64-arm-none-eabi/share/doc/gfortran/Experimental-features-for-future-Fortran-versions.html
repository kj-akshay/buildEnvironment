<p>GNU Fortran supports some experimental features that have been
proposed and accepted by the J3 standards committee.  These
exist to give users a chance to try them out, and to provide
a reference implementation.
</p>
<p>As these features have not been included in the worklist for Fortran
202Y by WG5, there is a chance that a version in any upcoming standard
will differ from what GNU Fortran currently implements.  These
features are therefore currently classified as an extension.
