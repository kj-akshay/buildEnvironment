<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-small-IPA-passes"></a>
<p>A small IPA pass is a pass derived from <code class="code">simple_ipa_opt_pass</code>.
As described in <a class="ref" href="IPA.html">Using summary information in IPA passes</a>, it does everything at once and 
defines only the <em class="emph">Execute</em> stage.  During this
stage it accesses and modifies the function bodies.
No <code class="code">generate_summary</code>, <code class="code">read_summary</code>, or <code class="code">write_summary</code>
hooks are defined.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>IPA free lang data

<p>This pass frees resources that are used by the front end but are
not needed once it is done.  It is located in <samp class="file">tree.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_ipa_free_lang_data</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA function and variable visibility

<p>This is a local function pass handling visibilities of all symbols.  This
happens before LTO streaming, so <samp class="option">-fwhole-program</samp> should be ignored
at this level.  It is located in <samp class="file">ipa-visibility.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_ipa_function_and_variable_visibility</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA remove symbols

<p>This pass performs reachability analysis and reclaims all unreachable nodes.
It is located in <samp class="file">passes.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_ipa_remove_symbols</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA OpenACC

<p>This is a pass group for OpenACC processing.  It is located in
<samp class="file">tree-ssa-loop.cc</samp> and is described by <code class="code">pass_ipa_oacc</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA points-to analysis

<p>This is a tree-based points-to analysis pass. The idea behind this analyzer
is to generate set constraints from the program, then solve the resulting
constraints in order to generate the points-to sets.  It is located in 
<samp class="file">tree-ssa-structalias.cc</samp> and is described by <code class="code">pass_ipa_pta</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA OpenACC kernels

<p>This is a pass group for processing OpenACC kernels regions.  It is a
subpass of the IPA OpenACC pass group that runs on offloaded functions
containing OpenACC kernels loops.  It is located in
<samp class="file">tree-ssa-loop.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_ipa_oacc_kernels</code>.
</p>
</li><li>Target clone

<p>This is a pass for parsing functions with multiple target attributes.
It is located in <samp class="file">multiple_target.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_target_clone</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA auto profile

<p>This pass uses AutoFDO profiling data to annotate the control flow graph.
It is located in <samp class="file">auto-profile.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_ipa_auto_profile</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA tree profile

<p>This pass does profiling for all functions in the call graph. 
It calculates branch
probabilities and basic block execution counts. It is located
in <samp class="file">tree-profile.cc</samp> and is described by <code class="code">pass_ipa_tree_profile</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA free function summary

<p>This pass is a small IPA pass when argument <code class="code">small_p</code> is true.
It releases inline function summaries and call summaries.
It is located in <samp class="file">ipa-fnsummary.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_ipa_free_free_fn_summary</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA increase alignment

<p>This pass increases the alignment of global arrays to improve
vectorization. It is located in <samp class="file">tree-vectorizer.cc</samp>
and is described by <code class="code">pass_ipa_increase_alignment</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA transactional memory

<p>This pass is for transactional memory support.
It is located in <samp class="file">trans-mem.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_ipa_tm</code>.
</p>
</li><li>IPA lower emulated TLS

<p>This pass lowers thread-local storage (TLS) operations
to emulation functions provided by libgcc.
It is located in <samp class="file">tree-emutls.cc</samp> and is described by
<code class="code">pass_ipa_lower_emutls</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>
