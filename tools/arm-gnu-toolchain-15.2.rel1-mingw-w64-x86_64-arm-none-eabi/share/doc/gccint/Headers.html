<h4 class="subsection" id="Headers-Installed-by-GCC"><span>5.3.6 Headers Installed by GCC<a class="copiable-link" href="#Headers-Installed-by-GCC"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>In general, GCC expects the system C library to provide most of the
headers to be used with it.  However, GCC will fix those headers if
necessary to make them work with GCC, and will install some headers
required of freestanding implementations.  These headers are installed
in <samp class="file"><var class="var">libsubdir</var>/include</samp>.  Headers for non-C runtime
libraries are also installed by GCC; these are not documented here.
(FIXME: document them somewhere.)
</p>
<p>Several of the headers GCC installs are in the <samp class="file">ginclude</samp>
directory.  These headers, <samp class="file">iso646.h</samp>,
<samp class="file">stdarg.h</samp>, <samp class="file">stdbool.h</samp>, and <samp class="file">stddef.h</samp>,
are installed in <samp class="file"><var class="var">libsubdir</var>/include</samp>,
unless the target Makefile fragment (see <a class="pxref" href="Target-Fragment.html">Target Makefile Fragments</a>)
overrides this by setting <code class="code">USER_H</code>.
</p>
<p>In addition to these headers and those generated by fixing system
headers to work with GCC, some other headers may also be installed in
<samp class="file"><var class="var">libsubdir</var>/include</samp>.  <samp class="file">config.gcc</samp> may set
<code class="code">extra_headers</code>; this specifies additional headers under
<samp class="file">config</samp> to be installed on some systems.
</p>
<p>GCC installs its own version of <code class="code">&lt;float.h&gt;</code>, from <samp class="file">ginclude/float.h</samp>.
This is done to cope with command-line options that change the
representation of floating point numbers.
</p>
<p>GCC also installs its own version of <code class="code">&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>; this is generated
from <samp class="file">glimits.h</samp>, together with <samp class="file">limitx.h</samp> and
<samp class="file">limity.h</samp> if the system also has its own version of
<code class="code">&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>.  (GCC provides its own header because it is
required of ISO C freestanding implementations, but needs to include
the system header from its own header as well because other standards
such as POSIX specify additional values to be defined in
<code class="code">&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>.)  The system&rsquo;s <code class="code">&lt;limits.h&gt;</code> header is used via
<samp class="file"><var class="var">libsubdir</var>/include/syslimits.h</samp>, which is copied from
<samp class="file">gsyslimits.h</samp> if it does not need fixing to work with GCC; if it
needs fixing, <samp class="file">syslimits.h</samp> is the fixed copy.
</p>
<p>GCC can also install <code class="code">&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code>.  It will do this when
<samp class="file">config.gcc</samp> sets <code class="code">use_gcc_tgmath</code> to <code class="code">yes</code>.
