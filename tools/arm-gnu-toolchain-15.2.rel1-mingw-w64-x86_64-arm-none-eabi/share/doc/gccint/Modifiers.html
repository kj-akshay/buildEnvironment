<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modifiers-in-constraints"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-constraint-modifier-characters"></a>

<p>Here are constraint modifier characters.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a id="index-_003d-in-constraint"></a><span>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">=</samp>&rsquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_003d-in-constraint"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Means that this operand is written to by this instruction:
the previous value is discarded and replaced by new data.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-_002b-in-constraint"></a><span>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">+</samp>&rsquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_002b-in-constraint"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.
</p>
<p>When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
it needs to know which operands are read by the instruction and
which are written by it.  &lsquo;<samp class="samp">=</samp>&rsquo; identifies an operand which is only
written; &lsquo;<samp class="samp">+</samp>&rsquo; identifies an operand that is both read and written; all
other operands are assumed to only be read.
</p>
<p>If you specify &lsquo;<samp class="samp">=</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">+</samp>&rsquo; in a constraint, you put it in the
first character of the constraint string.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-earlyclobber-operand"></a>
<a id="index-_0026-in-constraint"></a><span>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&amp;</samp>&rsquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_0026-in-constraint"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
<em class="dfn">earlyclobber</em> operand, which is written before the instruction is
finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may not lie
in a register that is read by the instruction or as part of any memory
address.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&amp;</samp>&rsquo; applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
requires &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&amp;</samp>&rsquo; while others do not.  See, for example, the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">movdf</samp>&rsquo; insn of the 68000.
</p>
<p>An operand which is read by the instruction can be tied to an earlyclobber
operand if its only use as an input occurs before the early result is
written.  Adding alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce
better code when only some of the read operands can be affected by the
earlyclobber. See, for example, the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">mulsi3</samp>&rsquo; insn of the ARM.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the <em class="dfn">earlyclobber</em> operand is also a read/write
operand, then that operand is written only after it&rsquo;s used.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&amp;</samp>&rsquo; does not obviate the need to write &lsquo;<samp class="samp">=</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">+</samp>&rsquo;.  As
<em class="dfn">earlyclobber</em> operands are always written, a read-only
<em class="dfn">earlyclobber</em> operand is ill-formed and will be rejected by the
compiler.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-_0025-in-constraint"></a><span>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">%</samp>&rsquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_0025-in-constraint"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange the
two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the
constraints.  &lsquo;<samp class="samp">%</samp>&rsquo; applies to all alternatives and must appear as
the first character in the constraint.  Only read-only operands can use
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">%</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>This is often used in patterns for addition instructions
that really have only two operands: the result must go in one of the
arguments.  Here for example, is how the 68000 halfword-add
instruction is defined:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(define_insn &quot;addhi3&quot;
  [(set (match_operand:HI 0 &quot;general_operand&quot; &quot;=m,r&quot;)
     (plus:HI (match_operand:HI 1 &quot;general_operand&quot; &quot;%0,0&quot;)
              (match_operand:HI 2 &quot;general_operand&quot; &quot;di,g&quot;)))]
  ...)
</pre></div>
<p>GCC can only handle one commutative pair in an asm; if you use more,
the compiler may fail.  Note that you need not use the modifier if
the two alternatives are strictly identical; this would only waste
time in the reload pass.
The modifier is not operational after
register allocation, so the result of <code class="code">define_peephole2</code>
and <code class="code">define_split</code>s performed after reload cannot rely on
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">%</samp>&rsquo; to make the intended insn match.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-_0023-in-constraint"></a><span>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">#</samp>&rsquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_0023-in-constraint"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
register preferences.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-_002a-in-constraint"></a><span>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_002a-in-constraint"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
register preferences.  &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo; has no effect on the meaning of the
constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.  For LRA
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo; additionally disparages slightly the alternative if the
following character matches the operand.
</p>
<p>Here is an example: the 68000 has an instruction to sign-extend a
halfword in a data register, and can also sign-extend a value by
copying it into an address register.  While either kind of register is
acceptable, the constraints on an address-register destination are
less strict, so it is best if register allocation makes an address
register its goal.  Therefore, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo; is used so that the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">d</samp>&rsquo;
constraint letter (for data register) is ignored when computing
register preferences.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(define_insn &quot;extendhisi2&quot;
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 &quot;general_operand&quot; &quot;=*d,a&quot;)
        (sign_extend:SI
         (match_operand:HI 1 &quot;general_operand&quot; &quot;0,g&quot;)))]
  ...)
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><a id="index-_002d-in-constraint"></a><span>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">-</samp>&rsquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#index-_002d-in-constraint"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Says that the selected following constraints within the same alternative
should be matched differently.  Normally in PIC code symbolic operands
in constraints like &lsquo;<samp class="samp">i</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">s</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">n</samp>&rsquo; are not allowed at all
or severely restricted.  The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-</samp>&rsquo; modifier, which is only allowed
outside of functions, allows symbolic operands even in PIC code.  This
modifier is usually used together with the <code class="code">cc</code> operand modifier.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">extern void foo (void), bar (void);
int v;
extern int w;
asm (&quot;.globl %cc0, %cc2; .text; %cc0: call %cc1; ret; .data; %cc2: .word %cc3&quot;
     :: &quot;:&quot; (foo), &quot;-s&quot; (&amp;bar), &quot;:&quot; (&amp;w), &quot;-i&quot; (&amp;v));
</pre></div>

<p>This asm declaration tells the compiler it defines function <code class="code">foo</code> and
variable <code class="code">w</code> and uses function <code class="code">bar</code> and variable <code class="code">v</code>.  This
will compile even with PIC, but it is up to the user to ensure it will
assemble correctly and have the expected behavior.
