<p>To read an RTL object from a file, call <code class="code">read_rtx</code>.  It takes one
argument, a stdio stream, and returns a single RTL object.  This routine
is defined in <samp class="file">read-rtl.cc</samp>.  It is not available in the compiler
itself, only the various programs that generate the compiler back end
from the machine description.
</p>
<p>People frequently have the idea of using RTL stored as text in a file as
an interface between a language front end and the bulk of GCC.  This
idea is not feasible.
</p>
<p>GCC was designed to use RTL internally only.  Correct RTL for a given
program is very dependent on the particular target machine.  And the RTL
does not contain all the information about the program.
</p>
<p>The proper way to interface GCC to a new language front end is with
the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; data structure, described in the files <samp class="file">tree.h</samp> and
<samp class="file">tree.def</samp>.  The documentation for this structure (see <a class="pxref" href="GENERIC.html">GENERIC</a>)
is incomplete.
